# BitSightAPI

This is a Python wrapper for the BitSight API. It provides a method to test the connection to the API (using the Requests module) and a method to query the API.

Currently the wrapper only supports GET requests, but updates will be made to support others, as well as implement query parameters and particular endpoints.
